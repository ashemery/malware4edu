Malware Samples that could be used for teaching students about malware analysis. The samples here are based on recommendations from the public with different backgrounds. Some of them are experts doing malware analysis, others shared their thoughts on which sample they found interesting and helped them learn about this field. I will keep updating this list as I find new interesting samples to add and hopefully will add some notes around each sample.

The discussion can be found here: [What malware samples would you recommend using to teach malware analysis for new students and why?](https://twitter.com/binaryz0ne/status/1431384541529260034)

Good luck!
