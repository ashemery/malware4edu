Malware Samples that could be used for teaching students about malware analysis. The samples here are based on recommendations from the public with different backgrounds. Some of them are experts doing malware analysis, others shared their thoughts on which sample they found interesting and helped them learn about this field. I will keep updating this list as I find new interesting samples to add and hopefully will add some notes around each sample.

## Below is what experts, researchers, students, etc said:
1. **Professor Duane Dunston** said: "A fakeAV sample.  It does a lot of the most common techniques discussed like obscure filename, install in users\public, change registry run key, the early versions weren't packed so you could see a lot of the details like imports, URL strings, etc." [here](https://twitter.com/gnugro/status/1431387303713386501)
2. **Expert Brian Maloney** said "I known it’s a little old now but what about Cryptowall? It is well documented by the late  
@ydklijnsma. I might have some samples laying around that aided in updating some of his tools. It would also be a nice tribute to an incredible person." [here](https://twitter.com/bmmaloney97/status/1431430380465360899) and also said "I also might have the pcap and procmon output to feed into 
@ProcDOT" [here](https://twitter.com/bmmaloney97/status/1431442394327797760)
3. **Charlie Crane** said "Emotet maldocs and similar because they are real world and quite cleaver in the way they hide parent/child processes relationships" [here](https://twitter.com/secprentice/status/1431400592786837512)
4. **Ahmet Payaslıoğlu** said "Emotet was a good example for me to analyze initially. Process injection, Network connections, new file creation, registry key changes, cryptography, etc... It could be a good example for beginners." [here](https://twitter.com/Computeus7/status/1431462842440503296)
5. **Waleed** said "When I started learning, I used StuxNet, and until now I don't know why!? xD" [here](https://twitter.com/D2Rz_/status/1431560631736471553)
6. **Professor Lionel Faleiro** said "I use Emotet and Adwind in my beginner trainings. Found good success with them." [here](https://twitter.com/sandmaxprime/status/1431421776324698115) and also said "Differentiating between Payloads and C2 traffic. Showing the different levels of analysis from beginner behavioral (fiddler,procmon,netmon) to code analysis (Obfuscation, decompiling, etc). I have some old posts on my blog" [here](https://twitter.com/sandmaxprime/status/1431599763447861251)
7. **John Poffenbarger** said "Sapphire/ Slammer? Compact. Lots of references beyond the 1s and 0s…which matters more than sometimes recognized." [here](https://twitter.com/jpoffenb/status/1431524560076169217)
8. **Jan** said "I have no direct Sample/Family to recommend but i would prefer something really difficult to cover as many obstacles as possible. I remember from the courses i took, everything was easy and working but in the real world everything was different." [here](https://twitter.com/_zero_q/status/1431524321143427072)
9. **Ayush Anand** said "This ransomware is quiet good for teaching, it contain multiple stages and teaches multiple techniques e.g. Uac bypass, ppid spoofing, wmi persistence, excel 4.0. File is not packed/not obfuscated so easy for students to read in assembly or pseudo code." [here](https://twitter.com/Securityinbits/status/1431563746925707267) and the blog post is [here](https://www.securityinbits.com/malware-analysis/parent-pid-spoofing-stage-2-ataware-ransomware-part-3/)
10. **Expert Florian Roth** said "Chafer‘s Remexi for a start, because it’s simple in its functionality and easy to disassemble & understand" [here](https://twitter.com/cyb3rops/status/1431510239602520065)
11. **Security Researcher Dr. Ahmed Shosha** said "I would craft binary bomb with real malware TTPs. Then gradually introduce simple real samples through the class. Preferably from old botnets that is no longer active or botnets that have been sinkholed (stuff that there public writeups for)." [here](https://twitter.com/Ahmedfshosha/status/1431554551543476224) and also said "For example Zeus and storm. Not very easy but fits the purpose." [here](https://twitter.com/Ahmedfshosha/status/1431555699792822274)
12. **Expert James** said "Anything #powershell related.....and #cobaltstrike....might as well get them used to seeing it early on." [here](https://twitter.com/James_inthe_box/status/1431641832505495553) and then he said "#powershell #empire is a good place to start." [here](https://twitter.com/James_inthe_box/status/1431666587455549442)
13. **Malware Researcher Myrtus** said "Hancitor, pretty straight forward and extremely consistent. No string encryption or API hashing either, and is still active almost everyday" [here](https://twitter.com/Myrtus0x0/status/1431633211004653568)
14. **InfoSecDodo** said "I'm still a noob in malware analysis, but malicious documents are great for learning static analysis. As for malware, I found RedLineStealer to be pretty straightforward for showing unpacking and injection. No anti debugging and common APIs, like WriteProcessMemory for injection" [here](https://twitter.com/dodo_sec/status/1431491960091648001) and the sample can be found [here](https://twitter.com/dodo_sec/status/1431492316339056642)
15. **Expert Abdalhalim Ashraf** said "I would recommend Meterpreter and it’s extensions. You/students can generate (have a control on) what to be analyze. Also they can have a look at the actual capabilities the malware provides to its operator. May it distract the students a bit?" [here](https://twitter.com/AshAbdalhalim/status/1431600402693304323)
16. **Threat Intel Professional Lord Xorington** said "I'd look back to some China related stuff like Ixeshe, comment crew samples, getkys, plugx, and other stuff like that. Get a good feel for things and a history lesson. Poison Ivy and Gh0st variants would also serve a similar purpose. And, definitely Cobalt Strike." [here](https://twitter.com/Xor_Lord/status/1431652935428198402)
17. **Threat Hunter Specialist Insomnihack** said "A variety: PS/VBA scripts, executables, loaders/droppers, compression/encoding/encryption, file/mem/net artefacts, lolbins, webshells, C2/Web panels. Why: If you just dig into one kind, you'll miss out on the whole picture." [here](https://twitter.com/pro_integritate/status/1431658043876560904)
18. **ZuriGorri20** said "I think we should start with the basics and not go right into multi-stage malware like Emotet, shouldn’t we? My first malware analysis was for RedLine Infostealer and learned A LOT (and most importantly, understood everything that was goung on)" [here](https://twitter.com/zurigorri20/status/1431582828014211078)
19. **Security Research M. Shahpasandi"** said "A hidden tear ransomware variant. Easy to disassemble and decrypable off course." [here](https://twitter.com/M_Shahpasandi/status/1431713106074480641)
20. **Investigator and Professor Chris Gastardi"** said "Have incorporated WannaCry into one of my courses. Tons of public reporting, real world application, drives home importance of VM snapshots, great for analysis in Ghidra or IDA." [here](https://twitter.com/ChrisGastardi/status/1431732874923937795) and also said "" [here](https://twitter.com/ChrisGastardi/status/1431733258413297665)
21. **Reverser and Researcher SOUITEN** said "Mirai and Gafgyt(Bashlite) are good 101 lessons. Simple,cross-platform, source code, still making noises." [here](https://twitter.com/souiten/status/1431968424348033026)
22.  **Researcher m4n0w4r** said "Many samples out there,but I think you can teach them about top of samples ITW.#Qakbot is one of them, used maldoc with #XLMmacro,unpack tech in loader Dll, main payload used junk code,encrypted strings, dynamic resolve APIs,evasion tech,anti-sndbox, encrypted configs,persistence" [here](https://twitter.com/kienbigmummy/status/1431962994141892611)
23.  **Security Analyst Eli Salem** said "Syswin" [here](https://twitter.com/elisalem9/status/1431939933590130688)
24.  **SeMSeM** said "Cobalt Strike" [here](https://twitter.com/EsMaTSeMSeM/status/1431977978850852873)
25.  
26.  Who's next? :)

## General Advice and Recommendations
1. **Krassen Deltchev** shared URLs to platforms where you can find malware samples [here](https://twitter.com/test2v/status/1431592331522842628)
2. **Edward Graham** said "Just beginning study. Probably best to have isolated laptop." [here](https://twitter.com/EdwardEGraham4/status/1431637991009570823)
3. **Cyb3rljack** said "any thing from you it will be very cool !! also i hope you to share it with us if you dont mind "free" , you can choose ransomware cuz its most common affected in the world. i am very happy to see your tweet about malware analysis really interesting." [here](https://twitter.com/Cyb3rIjack/status/1431947538828042246)
